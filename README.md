# .sub to .c16 Converter for HackRF PortaPack

Made by RockGod, fixed by me. This project contains a Python script that helps convert .sub files (Flipper SubGhz RAW File) to .c16 files for use with HackRF PortaPack. This project is a fork from broken code and has been fixed and improved. I fixed this using chatgpt, I know nothing. Supports two protocols: RAW and BinRAW.

## What You Need

- A computer with Python installed. 
- The NumPy library for Python. (This library helps with math operations.)

## Steps to Get Ready

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python, you can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2. Install NumPy

Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer and type the following:

```sh
pip install numpy
```
This command installs NumPy for Python.

### How to Use the Script
Step 1: Get Your Files Ready
Make sure you have a file that ends with .sub. This is the file you want to convert.

### How To Run the Script
Open the command prompt or terminal on your computer.

Go to the folder where you saved the script. For example, if it's saved in C:\Users\YourName\Documents, type:

```sh
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents
```
Now, run the script with the following command:

```sh
python sdr_converter.py your_signal.sub -o output_file -sr 500000 -if 5000 -a 100 -v
```
## What the Command Does
python sdr_converter.py runs the script.

your_signal.sub is the name of the file you want to convert.

-o output_file tells the script to save the new files with the name output_file.

-sr 500000 sets the sample rate to 500,000 samples per second.

-if 5000 sets the intermediate frequency to 5000 Hz.

-a 100 sets the amplitude to 100%.

-v enables verbose mode, which means the script will tell you what it's doing step by step.

### Step 3: Check the New Files
After you run the command, the script creates two new files:

##### output_file.c16: This is the main file you need.

##### output_file.txt: This file has extra information like the sample rate and frequency.

Example
Here's an example of how to run the script:

```sh
python sdr_converter.py my_signal.sub -o my_output -sr 500000 -if 5000 -a 100 -v
```
This converts my_signal.sub to my_output.c16 and my_output.txt.

### Extra Info

Sample Rate: This tells how many samples per second are used.

Intermediate Frequency: This helps adjust the signal.

Amplitude: This tells how strong the signal is.

# ORIGINAL README - WAS LABELED AS "BROKEN"


Welcome to the flipper-sub-to-hackrf-portapack-c16-converter repository. This project aims to convert .sub files to HackRF Portapack .c16 files using a Python script.

The primary script used here is heavily inspired by the JS files found at this [repository](https://github.com/rascafr/sub-to-c16). 
Thanks Fran√ßois for the initial work!

The main goal of this project is to convert all .sub files from [https://github.com/RocketGod-git/Flipper_Zero](https://github.com/RocketGod-git/Flipper_Zero) 
and load them into the HackRF repository [https://github.com/RocketGod-git/HackRF-Treasure-Chest](https://github.com/RocketGod-git/HackRF-Treasure-Chest).

If you have the time and skills to help improve this project, please don't hesitate to contribute. 
Feel free to PR fixes or additions.
